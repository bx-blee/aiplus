Emacs: The Ultimate AI Assistant

Dear colleague,

By mid-2025, AI integration into daily environments is universal.
Microsoft has embedded Copilot into Windows and 365 apps.
Google offers Gemini and "Google Assistant" for Android and Google Apps.
Apple has Siri and "Apple Intelligence."
In proprietary American digital ecosystems, profit-driven companies dictate
terms, and consumers accept what's provided.

In contrast, the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem (https://github.com/mohsenBanan)
offers a different approach. Our usage environment, Blee (https://github.com/bx-blee),
is rooted in Emacs.

AI integration in Emacs is particularly powerful.

Emacs, a 40+ year-old omni-context, editor-centered environment,
supports AI across all work contexts. Whether it's software
development (in any language), content creation and publishing
(such as LaTeX), sophisticated email management (like Gnus), or task
and time management (using org-mode), Emacs covers it all.

These activities now benefit from a unified AI-assistant model.
The ease of AI integration into Emacs is a testament to its core philosophy
(conviviality of tools) and flexibility. Emacs' AI integration can be tailored
to your preferences, allowing you to choose local (self-hosted) or remote AI
engines. While many options exist, setting up a cohesive system
requires some integration effort. And, that is not always easy.

With Blee and BISOS (ByStar Internet Services OS) --
https://github.com/bisos), we have achieved this integration by incorporating
two key Emacs AI interface packages:

1) **gptel** - [GitHub](https://github.com/karthink/gptel): This package offers
   a simple Large Language Model chat client for Emacs, supporting multiple
   models and backends. It maintains the Emacs spirit by being accessible at
   any time within any buffer.

2) **aidermacs** - [GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/aidermacs): Designed
   for AI pair programming in Emacs, Aidermacs integrates Aider—an
   open-source AI pair programming tool—into Emacs. It surpasses other
   integrations, like Cursor, through its seamless incorporation.

Think of gptel as a versatile, omnipresent chatbox and aidermacs as a
multilingual AI coding assistant. Installing these is straightforward, and
with Blee, they come fully integrated for efficient AI-enhanced workflows.

We have augmented these with an additional package called AIPlus
(https://github.com/bx-blee/aiplus). AIPlus includes various menus and
utilities for integrating aidermacs and gptel in Emacs and Blee.

In the proprietary American model, the integration of AI into usage
environments has accelerated surveillance capitalism and that trend will
continue. In the Libre-Halaal model (https://github.com/bxplpc/120033), with
the integration of AI into Emacs, we aim to preserve autonomy and control.

I'll continue using Emacs. Your call!
